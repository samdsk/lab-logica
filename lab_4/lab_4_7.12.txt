1. If a is a tetrahedron then it is in front of d.
	Tet(a) → FrontOf(a,d)

2. a is to the left of or right of d only if it’s a cube.
	(LeftOf(a, d) ∨ RightOf(a,d)) → Cube(a)

3. c is between either a and e or a and d.
	Between(c,a,e) ∨ Between(c,a,d)

5. c is to the right of d only if b is to the right of c and left of e.
	RightOf(c,d) → (RightOf(b,c) ∧ LeftOf(b,e))

6. If e is a tetrahedron, then it’s to the right of b if and only if it is also in front of b.
	Tet(e) → (RightOf(e, b) ↔ FrontOf(e, b))

7. If b is a dodecahedron, then if it isn’t in front of d then it isn’t in back of d either.
	(Dodec(b) → ¬FrontOf(b, d)) → ¬BackOf(b, d)

8. c is in back of a but in front of e.
	BackOf(c, a) ∧ FrontOf(c, e)
